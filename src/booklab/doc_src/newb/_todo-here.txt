TODOs when start work here:
- copy files from /bcat
- update their names to reflect this dir operation
- in the same way update their content 
- keep in mind that booklabd routes should acceot patameter <book_code>

- !! `index.html` existent can be dropped...
    it served as "fake" to keep dir and to address it from other pages before finish work
